# DACON--Growing-Environment-Competition
13th place code in the growing environment competition

## Explanation
It was My first pytorch-lightning code.<br>
I tried to give model semi-supervised learning. <br>
I used meta-data. but using metadata made false data-driven. <br>
It was good to use only image data for this competition.<br>
